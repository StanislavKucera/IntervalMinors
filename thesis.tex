\def\Dedication{%
I would very much like to thank my supervisor, V{\'i}t Jel{\'i}nek. He has been the one who sparked my interest in discrete mathematics and getting my first A from his exam was probably the base of all my school achievements. Somehow, he always knew when to step up and when to give me space and it is safe to say that his mentoring determined my future for a few upcoming years.
I would also like to thank my classmate and friend, Adam Horn{\'a}{\v{c}}ek, who has been there for me when I needed him.

% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
Interval minors of binary matrices were introduced by Jacob Fox in the study of Stanley--Wilf limits. We study what can be implied from their relation to the theory of pattern avoidance of submatrices, which is a very popular area of discrete mathematics. We start by characterizing matrices avoiding small interval minors. We then consider classes of matrices closed under interval minors and we find classes of matrices that cannot be described by a finite number of forbidden interval minors. We also define and study a variant of a classical extremal Tur{\'a}n-type question studied in the area of combinatorics of permutations and binary matrices and in combinatorial geometry.
